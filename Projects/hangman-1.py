# Day 7.1 => Only make a list of word, take random word and check if the user entered right or wrong word
# Day 7.2 => Make a list of underscore("_") and if the user guess right word then replace the underscore by that word
# Day 7.3 => Make a loop that will run and get a word from the user untill the length of random words end
# Day 7.4 => Make stages that will decrease if the user guess wrong word
# Day 7.5 => Make the game more useful. If the user enter a word that is already used by this user then notify him.

# Import modules

# In this day we will build a hangman game. This is simple game and this will get a random number from the list and ask the user to guess it.
# If he guess right then he will have 5 lives but if he guess wrong then he will lose one live.
# And that is how this game will work.

# First of all we will get a word from the list.
# For testing purpose we only give one word in the list
