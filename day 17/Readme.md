Day 17

In this day we will build a true false game.

In this game we will ask a question from the user and the will answer as true or false.

If the user has given a correct answer then his score will increase by one otherwise he will got nothing and next question will be asked.

This process will go through if the user enter wrong word instead of true or false.

This game will completely done by OOP. It means that we will make classes, their attributes and their methods.
